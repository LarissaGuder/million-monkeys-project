Hadoop project to randomly recreate Shakespeare

The source code for the Million Monkeys project.

This project comes from one of my favorite Simpsons episodes which has a scene where Mr. Burns brings Homer to his mansion (YouTube Video). One of his rooms has a thousand monkeys at a thousand typewriters. One of the monkeys writes a slightly incorrect line from Charles Dickens ‘It was the best of times, it was blurst of times.’ The joke is a play on the theory that a million monkeys sitting at a million typewriters will eventually produce Shakespeare. And that is what I did. I created millions of monkeys on Amazon and put them at virtual typewriters (aka Infinite Monkey Theorem).
